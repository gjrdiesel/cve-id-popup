# CVE ID Popup Chrome Extension

Inspired by https://twitter.com/micahhausler/status/1557420670044323840

> Does anyone in #infosec Twitter know of a browser extension that can allows for mouseover/highlight of a CVE ID text on a page and can popup with issue details? Seems like it would be crazy useful #DEFCON30

This chrome extension does that. It's still a WIP, but it's a start.

Feel free to jump in with API resources you might know about, style changes, or submit bug reports with how it works or doesn't work on certain sites in the issues tab.

# Installation

At the moment, it's not in the chrome extension store, so go ahead and do the following to install/develop the current version:

  git clone [repo]

  Open chrome, and go to chrome://extensions/

  Select "developer mode" from the right

  Hit "Load unpacked" extension and point it to the repo you cloned to.
